We've now injected a number of faults into our environment, but they've all be "all or nothing style faults".  In the Abort module, we highlighted the percentage of fault impact on the system.  In this challenge, you should take the virtualservice definition for the abort fault, and change the percentage of impact to 50 percent.  Re-run the test to show that the fault happens approximately 50 percent of the time.
